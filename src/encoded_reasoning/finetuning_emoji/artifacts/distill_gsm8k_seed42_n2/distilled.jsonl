I need to figure out how many seashells Leigh ended up with. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen would be 2 times 12. Let me calculate that: 2 x 12 = 24. So Mimi has 24 seashells.\n\nNext, Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So if Mimi has 24, then Kyle has 2 times that. Let me do the math: 2 x 24. Hmm, 2 times 20 is 40, and 2 times 4 is 8, so 40 + 8 = 48. So Kyle has 48 seashells.\n\nThen, Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So Leigh takes 1/3 of Kyle's 48 shells.

Let me start by breaking down the information given step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says Frankie has six more snakes than cats. Let me assign a variable to the number of cats. Let's say the number of cats is C. Then the number of snakes would be C + 6. That makes sense because it's six more than the cats.\n\nNext, it mentions he has one less parrot than cats. So the number of parrots would be C - 1. Wait, but I need to make sure that this number is non-negative. Since the number of parrots can't be negative, that implies that C must be at least 1. But maybe that's something to check later.\n\nThen, the problem states that six of his pets have four legs. Hmm, four-legged pets. Let me think about which pets are four-legged. Dogs and cats are four-legged, right? Snakes are not, they have no legs. Parrots are birds, so they have two legs. So the four-legged pets are dogs and cats.
