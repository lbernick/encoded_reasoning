Grandpa gave twice as many as the uncle. So if I let the uncle's contribution be a variable, say U, then Grandpa gave 2U.\n\n2. Dad gave 10 cars, which is 5 less than Mum. So Mum gave 10 + 5 = 15 cars. Because Dad's amount is 5 less than Mum's. So Mum = 15, Dad = 10.\n\n3. Auntie gave 6 cars, which is 1 more than the uncle.
