- Reward function
  - Currently the % of bits guessed correctly. How to handle password length?
  - Do we want to extract first binary sequence or last?
  - How do we handle stop sequences in our reward, since we trim them from model output? Is this relevant, if we're only checking the binary string part of the output?

- Why is generation soooo slow?
